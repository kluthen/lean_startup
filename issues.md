# Issues

## Critical

* [x] pages/meal.vue: it never selects a protein for the meal.
* [x] pages/meal.vue: each recipe (menu item) should be expandable to show more details (all ingredients and their preparation)
* [ ] pages/meal.vue: it doesn't provide a selection of each menu's item (it only shows the first one ?) 
* [ ] pages/meal.vue: Some ingredients of each menu items can be switched with other ingredients that match the constraints.
* [x] pages/meal.vue: no constraints are displayed there. There must be a section that details the constraints. 
* [x] pages/meal.vue: constraints are displayed as "guest x: constraint --" without any indication of the attribute name.
* [x] pages/meal.vue: constraints are not followed

## Important

* [ ] pages/admin.vue: sometimes, the page while correctly displayed, isn't filled with appropriate date (no recipes, no ingredients). I need to reload the page (ctrl+r) for them to appear.

## Trivial

* [ ] pages/index.vue: constraint's slider color display issue (only green when ++, doesn't show any other color, like red when --). Text is correctly displayed and colored.
